# ActiveDirectory-Helper - The story

**ActiveDirectory-Helper** module was born out of necessity and lazyness for all those administrators who, like me, deal with alot of *Identity Management* in Active Directory and don't want to write over the same LDAP filters over and over. 

## About

Like most all the code I wrote emphasis has been put on performances especially when working with larger datasets, currently all cmdlets in the module are used in a mid environment of circa 20k users with good performances.

## Collaborate

In the spirit of *eating my own dog food* I use this module and all its cmdlets in a production environment so I've tailored many of the cmdlets on stuff I need almost on a daily basis but please fee free to open an issue to suggest an idea, report a problem or if you want to implement a feature yourself open a PR!
